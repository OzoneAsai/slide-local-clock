# Local Clock Slideshow

This project shows a clock with a photo slideshow in the browser. The `index.html` uses JavaScript to rotate through images from the `public/static` directory.

## Running

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```
   The page will be available at <http://localhost:3000>.

Place any background images (jpg, png, gif) inside `public/static` and they will be included in the slideshow.
